The AI team will begin by studying the book "Neural
Networks From Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukieła. The team will
work through the book's content, implementing the concepts in Python, and will
also explore additional resources to deepen their understanding of neural
networks.

* [Neural Networks From Scratch](https://nnfs.io/) - The book by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukieła.
* [Neural Networks From Scratch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sentdex/nnfs_book) - The official GitHub repository for the book, containing code examples and exercises.
* [Neural Networks From Scratch animations](https://nnfs.io/neural_network_animations) - Animations for core concepts in the book. 
* [Repository of AI books](https://github.com/aridiosilva/AI_Books). Some optional books that may be interesting. 

After we get comforatable with the structure and implementation of neural networks
