title: Data, ML, Statistics Team

Students on the Data, ML and Stats team will learn the basics of
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
then explore either basic data analysis or machine learning topics. 

For statistics, I recommend the book [Statistics in Plain English](https://a.co/d/9vLbOJf) 
by Timothy C. Urdan. The book is also 
[available for about $5 on ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Statistics+in+Plain+English&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_sop=15), 
or for free at the [Internet Archive](https://scispace.com/pdf/statistics-in-plain-english-33wu7x4b93.pdf)
