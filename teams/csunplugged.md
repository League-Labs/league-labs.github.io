The CS Unplugged Team will work on the _Coding With Cards_ class, which 
uses physical cards to teach algorithms and data structures. 

This class will teach students: 

* Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort,
  merge sort, quick sort, tim sort
* Search algorithms: linear search, binary search, breadth-first search, depth-first search
* Baisc data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps

For each of the modules, students will learn the algorithms using physical
cards, web animations, and then implement them in Python.


Here are some examples of teaching sorting algorithms with cards:

Basic Tim sort:
