The CS Unplugged Team will work on the _Coding With Cards_ class, which 
uses physical cards to teach algorithms and data structures. 

This class will teach students: 

* Sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort,
  merge sort, quick sort, tim sort
* Search algorithms: linear search, binary search, breadth-first search, depth-first search
* Baisc data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps

For each of the modules, students will learn the algorithms using physical
cards, web animations, and then implement them in Python.
