Members of the Python team will work on various projects that involve programming in Python, with some students focusing specifically on machine vision using OpenCV2.

# Vision

We will start learning basic operations in OpenCV2, a Python library for computer
vision, then we will move on to more advanced topics such as image processing,
object detection, and image segmentation.
