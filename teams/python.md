Members of the Python team will work on various projects that involve programming in Python, with some students focusing specifically on machine vision using OpenCV2.


## Project Ideas

* League Version of code challenges, like Leetcode, Hacker Rank or Code wars
* Python games with PyGame 
* Web applications with Flask, FastHTML or FastAPI
* Simple data analysis with Jupyter and Pandas
* Advanced Python syntax: comprehensions, generators, slicing, exceptions

## Vision

We will start learning basic operations in OpenCV2, a Python library for computer
vision, then we will move on to more advanced topics such as image processing,
object detection, and image segmentation.
