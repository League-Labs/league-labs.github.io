title: Robots
---

The LEAGUE is developing new robotics classes for younger students, but we
currently have more robot parts than we have robot classes. We need some young
builders to help, by building robots and creating new classes.

We have multiple kinds of robots, and a lot of ideas for classes. Most of the
robots use the Micro:bit controllers, but others are Arduino. We have radio
joysticks to control them, servos, grippers and  sonar modules. Some of the
parts we’ll attach to them are Lego, but we’ll also be 3D printing new parts.
After building some robots, we will find some fun things to do with them.

The intern’s tasks will include:

* Building robot kits
* Making attachments with Legos
* Designing and printing 3D parts
* Soldering simple electronics parts

We especially need 3D designers to design attachments for the robots that we can
3D print, for instance a part that connect a servo to the front of our robots.
Most of these attachment will involve re-mixing existing designs, but the design
will require a lot of creativity.
