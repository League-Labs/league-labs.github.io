League Labs is the introductory internship program for the League of Amazing
Programmers. Interns in the League Labs program study a topic related to
programming or computer science, develop a short class and teach the class to
other students. For details on the prgram and to apply for the next cohort please
visit the [League Labs page at our main website. ](https://www.jointheleague.org/coding-programs/league-labs/)

To fully participate in the League Labs program, you will need to apply at the main League Labs
web page, be a member of the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/jointheleague.org/g/labs), and
join the Discord server. Contact Eric Busboom if you think you should have access to the group or 
Discord server and do not.
