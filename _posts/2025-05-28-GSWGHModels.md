If you are joining an AI team, you [should join this meetup](https://www.meetup.com/the-league-code-clinic/events/308112244), 
where we will show you how to get started with AI models using free tools that make it easy to work with AI. 

You can get started writing an AI app -- sending data to ChatGPT and getting a
response back -- in about 5 minutes with GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Models.

We will show you how to add an AI model to your Github repo, start an online
IDE, and write your first AI program.

Attendees to this meeting should have a Github account to fully participate.

The meeting will be held, **Thursday, June 5, 2025 from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM PDT**.
